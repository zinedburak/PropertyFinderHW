#Property Finder - BootCamp Lecture 1

- The book that we are going to use is = Go programming Language

- First Class Citizen and Second Class Citizen in programming = Make a research


## Basic knowledge

- Good documentation in go.dev

- Effective Go Page
  - Packages
  - Command Documentation
  - Effective_go#names for naming convention in golang

Language Specifications - Little hard to read but very useful

## Properties of Go

First-class functions = Is a notion of functional programing. You can use functions as variables.
Immutable strings encoded in Unicode
Standard library and APIs for basic structures such as collection, networking, I/O, text processing etc.
It is a compiled language; it compiles to native machine code
Go’s main objective is simplicity in programming

Execution always starts by default with the main function which is declared in the main package.
Main function does not get any argument or it does not return anything that is the HARD rule


## Object-Oriented Programming in Go

A struct is a type for data abstraction in Go
Functions can be associated with struct types
There is no class or equivalent type in GO
Instances of a struct type can be created by passing literals
Then associated functions, which are methods, can be invoked on those instances
That is basically how OOP is implemented in Go


## Functional Programing in Go

Go supports well-known mechanisms of functional programming.
In Go, functions are first-class citizens so they can be assigned to variables and passed to or returned from other functions
Go also supports anonymous functions or closures

## Some Observations about Go
As you notice
Go is a block structured language where blocks are declared using a pair of brackets.
Go pays lots of attention to code formatting; it also has a special tool, go fit for this purpose
Go generally doesn’t require us to put a semicolon at the end of statements
